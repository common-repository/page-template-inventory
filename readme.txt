Take stock of the page templates that your theme has: what is being used and what is not.

== Description ==

Over the course of the development of a custom theme or application, custom page templates can start to build up. This plugin adds a "template inventory" tool which lets you see which templates are actually used.

Development of this plugin was supported by [Arts at MIT](http://arts.mit.edu).

== Installation ==

1. Install the Page Template Inventory plugin and activate.
2. Click on the "Template Inventory" item under the "Appearance" section of the admin.
3. This will show you all the page templates in the current theme and how many pages are using them. Edit and delete actions are available for each template.
